Data Collection: I used the GitHub API (version 2022-11-28) to retrieve user data from Austin with over 100 followers, saving details like login, name, and bio into users.csv. I then pulled up to 500 most recent public repositories per user, storing fields like language, stars, and licenses in repositories.csv.

Interesting Finding: Surprisingly, "Fennel" had the highest average stargazers per repository, despite its relative obscurity compared to widely-used languages like JavaScript and HTML.

Recommendation: Developers can potentially increase their following by creating more repositories, as each additional repository is associated with an estimated 4.090 additional followers.

Note: Q13 was solved in google colab using python. Other questions were solved using excel, mostly with pivot tables.
